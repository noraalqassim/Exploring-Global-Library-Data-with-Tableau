# ðŸ“š Exploring Global Library Data with Tableau

This project is part of the **IBM Data Analytics with Excel and R Capstone** course, specifically within the module: *Data Visualization with Tableau*. The objective of this project is to demonstrate basic Tableau skills including data connection, visualization, dashboard creation, and storytelling.

## ðŸ“Š About Tableau

**Tableau** is a powerful data visualization tool that enables users to analyze data and create interactive and shareable dashboards. It simplifies raw data into an understandable format, using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps.

### What is a Dashboard in Tableau?

A **Dashboard** is a collection of views, such as charts and tables, brought together on a single canvas. Dashboards allow users to compare data side-by-side and interact with the visualizations using filters and actions.


## Project Overview

The dataset used in this project is titled **"Global Library Data.xlsx"**, which contains information about libraries across various world regions.

### Step 1: Data Connection & Exploration

- Connected to the Excel file and previewed the data.
- Verified data structure and ensured fields were correctly interpreted by Tableau.

### Step 2: Analyze Data in Two Views

Created two visualizations to explore the dataset:

1. **Bar Chart** â€“ *Total Libraries by Region*  
   This chart shows a comparison of library counts across different regions.

2. **Crosstab View** â€“ for detailed tabular representation.

> These visualizations are available in the Tableau workbook:  
**`Analyze data in two views_starter.twbx`**

### Step 3: Create a Dashboard

- Combined both views in an interactive dashboard to make the data more accessible and meaningful.
- Added filters and layout adjustments to improve usability.
